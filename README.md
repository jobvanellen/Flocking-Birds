#Bird flocking simulation using Boids
##Engineering fundamentals assessment project

The Boids algorithm is comprised of three central behavioural traits:

1. Separation: Steering to avoid crowding local flockmates
2. Alignment: Steering towards the average heading of local flockmates
3. Cohesion: Steering to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates
